🌐 **[myvirtualoffice.ai](https://myvirtualoffice.ai/)**

A self-hosted 2D AI workspace for AI Agents. Turn invisible agent work into a living, breathing office.

## What Is It?

Virtual Office gives your AI agents a physical presence. Instead of watching logs scroll by, you see agents walking between desks, grabbing coffee, sitting in meetings, and chatting in a charming 2D style office that runs in your browser.

It connects to supported agent harnesses and visualizes what your agents are doing in real time.

## Supported Agent Harnesses

### OpenClaw

Virtual Office connects to OpenClaw through the OpenClaw gateway and the mounted OpenClaw home directory. The gateway provides live chat and activity events, while the home directory lets Virtual Office discover agents, read safe profile metadata, load model settings, and surface workspace tools in the UI.

For Docker deployments, mount your OpenClaw home directory into the container and set `VO_OPENCLAW_PATH`, `VO_GATEWAY_URL`, and `VO_GATEWAY_HTTP` when the defaults do not match your setup.

### Hermes Agents

Virtual Office can connect Hermes as a first-class office agent through the Hermes API Server, a reachable Hermes Desktop Backend, or the Hermes CLI/home directory as an optional fallback for profile discovery and profile management. Native API chat uses Hermes' `/v1/runs` and SSE event stream when the API server is available. Desktop Backend chat uses the documented `hermes serve` TUI-gateway JSON-RPC/WebSocket surface. Local Virtual Office history is stored under `VO_STATUS_DIR`.

For Docker deployments, point `VO_HERMES_API_URL` at the host gateway, usually `http://host.docker.internal:8642`, and set `VO_HERMES_API_KEY` to the Hermes `API_SERVER_KEY`. If using Desktop Backend mode with an already-open Desktop app, set `VO_HERMES_DESKTOP_URL` to the loopback URL that Desktop's `hermes serve` backend is bound to, such as `http://127.0.0.1:62353`. Docker-hosted Virtual Office routes loopback Desktop URLs through `host.docker.internal` while preserving Hermes' expected `127.0.0.1:<port>` Host identity. The setup/settings Auto Discover button can use an exposed Desktop readiness log path, a previously entered URL, or visible loopback listeners; Docker still cannot reliably discover a private host Desktop port unless that port or log is exposed to the container. Mount or otherwise expose the Hermes home directory and CLI path only when you want CLI fallback/profile management. Hermes secrets, private memory files, and config internals are not read or exposed.

Virtual Office also ships a Hermes Messaging Gateway platform plugin under `integrations/hermes-platform/my_virtual_office/`. This is a different mode: Hermes gateway connects to Virtual Office as a messaging platform, so the `Hermes Gateway` office agent can receive queued Virtual Office messages and post replies back into visible office chat. Configure `VO_HERMES_PLATFORM_TOKEN` on Virtual Office, copy the plugin into `~/.hermes/plugins/my_virtual_office/`, set `MY_VIRTUAL_OFFICE_URL` and `MY_VIRTUAL_OFFICE_TOKEN` for Hermes, then run `hermes gateway`.

### Codex

Virtual Office can create Codex-backed office agents when the Codex CLI is available to the app. Chat uses Codex's native `codex app-server` JSON-RPC protocol for thread start/resume, live progress, approval requests, and interrupt support. `codex exec` is retained only as an explicit compatibility fallback.

Discovery includes Virtual Office-created Codex agents, Codex's standard `$CODEX_HOME/agents/*.toml` custom agents, and a synthesized `Main` entry for the default Codex root agent. Newly created Virtual Office Codex agents can use the default Codex agents directory or a custom parent directory. Default-directory creation registers a native custom-agent TOML file under `$CODEX_HOME/agents` when `VO_CODEX_REGISTER_NATIVE_AGENTS=1`; custom-directory creation writes a project-local `.codex/agents/<profile>.toml` and keeps a small Virtual Office registry so the agent remains discoverable.

For Docker deployments, install Codex inside the container image or set `VO_CODEX_BIN` to a Codex executable path available inside the container. Set `VO_CODEX_HOME` to a deployment-specific Codex home so auth and config stay out of the repo and are not tied to any developer's machine. Useful variables: `VO_CODEX_BIN`, `VO_CODEX_HOME`, `VO_CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, `VO_CODEX_MAIN_WORKSPACE`, `VO_CODEX_INCLUDE_MAIN`, `VO_CODEX_INCLUDE_NATIVE_AGENTS`, `VO_CODEX_REGISTER_NATIVE_AGENTS`, `VO_CODEX_PREFER_APP_SERVER`, `VO_CODEX_SANDBOX`, and `VO_CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY`. The Docker example defaults `VO_CODEX_SANDBOX` to `danger-full-access` because Codex's bubblewrap sandbox usually needs extra container privileges; set it to a stricter Codex sandbox mode when your deployment supports it.

### Claude Code

Virtual Office can create Claude Code-backed office agents when the Claude Code CLI is available to the app. Chat uses Claude Code's native non-interactive stream protocol, `claude -p --output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages`, so text deltas, tool calls, tool results, usage, session IDs, interrupts, and local Virtual Office chat history work like the other native harness providers.

Discovery includes Virtual Office-created Claude Code agents, Claude Code's native `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents/*.md` subagents, and a synthesized `Main` entry for Claude Code's default workspace agent. Newly created Virtual Office Claude Code agents can use the default managed workspace root or a custom parent directory. Standard creation writes `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, project `.claude/agents/<profile>.md`, and, when `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_REGISTER_NATIVE_AGENTS=1`, a native `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents/<profile>.md` subagent file. Custom creation writes the project-local subagent file and a small Virtual Office registry entry so the agent remains discoverable.

For Docker deployments, install Claude Code inside the container image or set `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_BIN` to a Claude executable path available inside the container. Set `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_HOME` to a deployment-specific Claude config directory so auth and config stay out of the repo and are not tied to any developer's machine. Useful variables: `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_BIN`, `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_HOME`, `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_MAIN_WORKSPACE`, `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL`, `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_PERMISSION_MODE`, `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_INCLUDE_MAIN`, `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_INCLUDE_NATIVE_AGENTS`, and `VO_CLAUDE_CODE_REGISTER_NATIVE_AGENTS`.

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliautobot/my-virtual-office.git
cd my-virtual-office
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:8090/setup` to run the setup wizard.

### Docker Image / Platform Support

The published Docker image is available at:
- `ghcr.io/eliautobot/my-virtual-office:latest`

Multi-arch images are published for:
- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/arm64`

That means the same image tag works on standard x86_64 machines and ARM64 devices like a Raspberry Pi 5.

### First Run

1. Open `http://localhost:8090/setup`
2. Follow the setup wizard to connect your OpenClaw instance, Hermes Agents, or both
3. Enter a license key or skip for demo mode
4. Customize your office, add agents, and watch them come to life

## Remote Access and Security

**Recommended remote access: use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).**

Virtual Office is a control surface for your local agent harnesses. If you want to reach it away from home, the safest default is to keep it on your private machine or LAN and access it over a private tailnet such as Tailscale.

### Recommended setup
- Keep Virtual Office bound to your local machine, LAN, or private tailnet
- Use Tailscale to reach the host remotely instead of opening router ports
- Keep your agent harnesses and Virtual Office behind trusted access controls
- Use strong device/account security on the machines that can reach your tailnet

### Warning
- **Do not expose Virtual Office directly to the public internet unless you fully understand and accept the security risk**
- Avoid simple port forwarding for ports `8090`, `8091`, or your agent harness gateways
- If someone can reach your Virtual Office deployment, they may be able to interact with a live control surface for your agents

This project is designed first for self-hosted local/private-network use. You are responsible for securing any remote deployment.
